    "# Predicting Wait Times with Lag Features and Differencing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a time series forecasting model to predict wait times. We'll use a linear regression model and engineer features using two common techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Lag Features**: We will create features that represent past values of the time series. This helps the model understand the state of the system at previous time steps.\n",
    "2.  **Differencing**: To stabilize the time series and make it easier to model, we will predict the *change* in wait time from one period to the next, rather than the absolute wait time itself.\n",

    "\n",
