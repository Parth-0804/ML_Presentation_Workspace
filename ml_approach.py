Refined Analysis & Forecasting of Attraction Wait Times

This script provides a comprehensive, end-to-end analysis of the 'ARTHUR' attraction
wait time dataset. The analysis is structured into three main parts:
1.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.
2.  A phased Predictive Modeling approach, starting from a simple baseline and
    progressing to advanced models with feature engineering.
3.  A final summary of findings and actionable recommendations.

The code is designed to be run sequentially, with outputs and explanations
provided at each stage to create a clear and understandable narrative.
